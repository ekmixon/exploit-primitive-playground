# Exploit Primitive Platform

Welcome to Red Canary's Exploit Primitive repository!

This project is intended to display techniques involved in weaponizing
exploits primitives, and how they effect a vulnerable application. All
primitives are designed to be contrived examples, so there is no effort
made to make them difficult to use.

# Usage

Build EPP.

```bash
make
```

Run EPP.

```bash
build/_X86_64/epp INTERFACE PORT
```

Use an example to launch any shellcode blob, Meterpreter is fast and works great.

```
./examples/remote_command_execution.py INTERFACE PORT ~/meterpreter.raw.shellcode
./examples/remote_code_execution.py INTERFACE PORT ~/meterpreter.raw.shellcode
```

The example's don't have to be executed on the same system that EPP is running on, but they can.


# Contributing

We are open to contributions for both different examples and primitives.
